      "1.5 Problem Statement\n",
      "Although rice is the third most important staple food in Kenya, its production is insufficient. More than 73 per cent of rice consumed in Kenya is imported from countries like Egypt, Tanzania, Thailand, among others at a cost of Ksh 8.75 billion per year (Atera et.al., 2011).  Rice produced in Kenya only meets 20 per cent of the demand with the difference being imported.  Annual rice production and consumption in the country between 1990 and 2018 averaged 45 thousand tons and 351 thousand tons, respectively.  This implies an average shortage of 306 thousand tons, which is imported. In the wake of the rice production shortages in the country, the Ministry of Agriculture came up with the National Rice Development Strategy (2008) in 2008. The strategy outlined several measures to increase production and reduce deficit from 227 thousand tons in 2008 to 198 thousand tons by 2017. However, the deficit continued to increase and hit 671 thousand tons in 2017 (USDA, 2018). \n",
      "Apart from Kuria et al.(2003) and Omondi and Shikuku (2010), Mwatete et.al. (2015), no other study has examined the technical efficiency of rice in Kenya. The latter two concentrated in Ahero and Kano Irrigation Schemes, while only the former studied Mwea Irrigation Schemes 15 years ago. Conclusion from these studies may not necessarily generalize to Mwea Irrigation Scheme, the largest scheme in the country. The current study therefore aims to fill this gap by measuring the level of rice technical efficiency in Mwea irrigation scheme and establishing the determinants of rice production in the scheme. \n",
      "1.6 Research Questions\n",
      "This study will be guided by the following research questions:\n",
      "(i) What is the level of technical efficiency of rice in Mwea Irrigation Scheme?\n",
      "(ii) What are the factors that affect rice production in Mwea Irrigation Scheme?\n",
      "(iii) What are the determinants of rice production efficiency in Mwea Irrigation Scheme?\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "1.7 Research Objectives\n",
      "The general objective of this study is to access rice production efficiency in Kenya, with specific focus on Mwea Irrigation Scheme. \n",
      "The specific objectives of this study are to:\n",
      "(i) Measure technical efficiency of rice in Mwea Irrigation Scheme\n",
      "(ii) Determine the factors that affect rice production in Mwea Irrigation Scheme\n",
      "(iii) Establish the determinants of rice production efficiency in Mwea Irrigation Scheme\n",
      "1.8 Significance of the study\n",
      "The study will supplement the existing literature concerning rice production in Kenya. It will be essential for the policy makers who would wish to promote rice production through promoting of efficient and competitive farm practices. \n",
      "The study will provide valuable information on the production efficiency of rice production in the country which will be beneficial to the government, development agencies and farmers working on the area related to the study.\n",
      " It is also expected that other researchers will build on the findings of this study to carry out further research to confirm, expound, improve or enrich their study findings.\n",
      "1.9 Scope and Limitations of the Study\n",
      "The study will focus on technical efficiency of rice producers at farm level in Mwea irrigation scheme in Kirinyaga County. This scheme will be selected for the study due to its importance in rice production in the country.\n",
      "It is the largest irrigation scheme in Kenya and produces nearly 80 per cent of the rice consumed in Kenya (Ministry of Agriculture, 2008).  In 2018, the scheme produced 73 per cent of all the rice in grown in the country (Republic of Kenya, 2018). \n",
      "This study has several limitations. First, rice channels like marketing and consumer stages will not be investigated.  This does not mean that they are less significant.\n",
      "Second, the results of this study will be based on a small representative sample of smallholder farmers in the county which may not necessarily be representative of the entire smallholder farmers. \n",
      "Finally, it is unlikely that farmers keep accurate data on application of input levels. Therefore, the study will rely on the data given by the respondents to achieve the study's objectives. \n",
      "1.10 Organization of the study\n",
      "The research proposal is divided into three chapters. Chapter one introduced the topic, outlined the problem statement and highlighted the objectives to be addressed by the study. Chapter two discuses both the theoretical and empirical literature review\n",
      " and Chapter three delineates the methodology to be undertaken in addressing the objectives of the study. \n",
      "Udayanganie et.al. (2006) assessed the technical efficiency of rice production in three irrigation blocks of Sri Lanka for the cultivation season 2003/04. The study used a sample of 225 farmers and a stochastic frontier analysis to measure the technical efficiency. \n",
      "Results showed a very low level of technical efficiency, of 0.37. The use of credit and extension services was found to be the major determinants of efficiency among the farmers.  The study also found a negative relationship between rice production and pesticides. \n",
      "This indicates excessive use of pesticides. The study did not consider other types of inefficiencies apart from technical efficiency.\n",
      "Tiajani (2006) estimated the technical efficiency of rice in Nigeria, Osun State using SFA. The study further analysed the socioeconomic factors that determine its production. Some of the independent variables used in the study are farm size, labour fertilizer,\n",
      " family size, farmer's age and experience, and off farm income, among others. The mean of technical efficiency was 86.6 and efficiency levels ranged from 29 to 98 per cent. Another key finding is that 75 per cent of the farmers were highly efficient (had a technical coefficient value of 90 per cent and above)\n",
      " while only seven per cent of them were least efficient, with a technical efficiency coefficient of between 30 and 40 per cent.\n",
      " The significant determinants of inefficiency were farm size, fertilizer, pesticides, presence of extension services, off farm income and cross product of labour and fertilizer. The limitation of the study is that it will not consider farm machines hours, which is an important factor of production. The study has also not stated the sample size used in the analysis and how it was determined. \n",

      "1.5 Problem Statement\n",
      "Although rice is the third most important staple food in Kenya, its production is insufficient. More than 73 per cent of rice consumed in Kenya is imported from countries like Egypt, Tanzania, Thailand, among others at a cost of Ksh 8.75 billion per year (Atera et.al., 2011).  Rice produced in Kenya only meets 20 per cent of the demand with the difference being imported.  Annual rice production and consumption in the country between 1990 and 2018 averaged 45 thousand tons and 351 thousand tons, respectively.  This implies an average shortage of 306 thousand tons, which is imported. In the wake of the rice production shortages in the country, the Ministry of Agriculture came up with the National Rice Development Strategy (2008) in 2008. The strategy outlined several measures to increase production and reduce deficit from 227 thousand tons in 2008 to 198 thousand tons by 2017. However, the deficit continued to increase and hit 671 thousand tons in 2017 (USDA, 2018). \n",
      "Apart from Kuria et al.(2003) and Omondi and Shikuku (2010), Mwatete et.al. (2015), no other study has examined the technical efficiency of rice in Kenya. The latter two concentrated in Ahero and Kano Irrigation Schemes, while only the former studied Mwea Irrigation Schemes 15 years ago. Conclusion from these studies may not necessarily generalize to Mwea Irrigation Scheme, the largest scheme in the country. The current study therefore aims to fill this gap by measuring the level of rice technical efficiency in Mwea irrigation scheme and establishing the determinants of rice production in the scheme. \n",
      "1.6 Research Questions\n",
      "This study will be guided by the following research questions:\n",
      "(i) What is the level of technical efficiency of rice in Mwea Irrigation Scheme?\n",
      "(ii) What are the factors that affect rice production in Mwea Irrigation Scheme?\n",
      "(iii) What are the determinants of rice production efficiency in Mwea Irrigation Scheme?\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "1.7 Research Objectives\n",
      "The general objective of this study is to access rice production efficiency in Kenya, with specific focus on Mwea Irrigation Scheme. \n",
      "The specific objectives of this study are to:\n",
      "(i) Measure technical efficiency of rice in Mwea Irrigation Scheme\n",
      "(ii) Determine the factors that affect rice production in Mwea Irrigation Scheme\n",
      "(iii) Establish the determinants of rice production efficiency in Mwea Irrigation Scheme\n",
      "1.8 Significance of the study\n",
      "The study will supplement the existing literature concerning rice production in Kenya. It will be essential for the policy makers who would wish to promote rice production through promoting of efficient and competitive farm practices. \n",
      "The study will provide valuable information on the production efficiency of rice production in the country which will be beneficial to the government, development agencies and farmers working on the area related to the study.\n",
      " It is also expected that other researchers will build on the findings of this study to carry out further research to confirm, expound, improve or enrich their study findings.\n",
      "1.9 Scope and Limitations of the Study\n",
      "The study will focus on technical efficiency of rice producers at farm level in Mwea irrigation scheme in Kirinyaga County. This scheme will be selected for the study due to its importance in rice production in the country.\n",
      "It is the largest irrigation scheme in Kenya and produces nearly 80 per cent of the rice consumed in Kenya (Ministry of Agriculture, 2008).  In 2018, the scheme produced 73 per cent of all the rice in grown in the country (Republic of Kenya, 2018). \n",
      "This study has several limitations. First, rice channels like marketing and consumer stages will not be investigated.  This does not mean that they are less significant.\n",
      "Second, the results of this study will be based on a small representative sample of smallholder farmers in the county which may not necessarily be representative of the entire smallholder farmers. \n",
      "Finally, it is unlikely that farmers keep accurate data on application of input levels. Therefore, the study will rely on the data given by the respondents to achieve the study's objectives. \n",
      "1.10 Organization of the study\n",
      "The research proposal is divided into three chapters. Chapter one introduced the topic, outlined the problem statement and highlighted the objectives to be addressed by the study. Chapter two discuses both the theoretical and empirical literature review\n",
      " and Chapter three delineates the methodology to be undertaken in addressing the objectives of the study. \n",
      "Udayanganie et.al. (2006) assessed the technical efficiency of rice production in three irrigation blocks of Sri Lanka for the cultivation season 2003/04. The study used a sample of 225 farmers and a stochastic frontier analysis to measure the technical efficiency. \n",
      "Results showed a very low level of technical efficiency, of 0.37. The use of credit and extension services was found to be the major determinants of efficiency among the farmers.  The study also found a negative relationship between rice production and pesticides. \n",
      "This indicates excessive use of pesticides. The study did not consider other types of inefficiencies apart from technical efficiency.\n",
      "Tiajani (2006) estimated the technical efficiency of rice in Nigeria, Osun State using SFA. The study further analysed the socioeconomic factors that determine its production. Some of the independent variables used in the study are farm size, labour fertilizer,\n",
      " family size, farmer's age and experience, and off farm income, among others. The mean of technical efficiency was 86.6 and efficiency levels ranged from 29 to 98 per cent. Another key finding is that 75 per cent of the farmers were highly efficient (had a technical coefficient value of 90 per cent and above)\n",
      " while only seven per cent of them were least efficient, with a technical efficiency coefficient of between 30 and 40 per cent.\n",
      " The significant determinants of inefficiency were farm size, fertilizer, pesticides, presence of extension services, off farm income and cross product of labour and fertilizer. The limitation of the study is that it will not consider farm machines hours, which is an important factor of production. The study has also not stated the sample size used in the analysis and how it was determined. \n",
