Why do we still experience symptoms in our bodies?\\n\\nI believe that the answer is found in what Jesus told the leper to do next. He told him to go and show himself to the priest. (Matthew 8:4) This was the law then for lepers who were healed. (Leviticus 14:2\\xe2\\x80\\x933) And he was to hear the priest pronounce the word \\xe2\\x80\\x9cclean\\xe2\\x80\\x9d over him.

He stretched forth His hand, touched the leper and said, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI am willing; be cleansed.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d And immediately, the leper was healed.\\n\\nI want you to notice that Jesus touched the leper.

He had healed others this way as in the case of the centurion\\xe2\\x80\\x99s servant and the Syro-Phoenician woman\\xe2\\x80\\x99s daughter.

This is\\nequivalent to 200 times the mass\\nof the Great Pyramid of Giza.\\nAround one-third of the food\\nproduced worldwide ends up\\ninedible as a result of pest\\ninfestation, or rots in warehouses\\nor in transit. Even some edible\\nfood lands, unused, in the trash-\\ncan.\\nVast amounts of water, energy, resources,\\nland and labor are wasted this way. The\\nannual financial damage adds up to almost\\n$1 trillion.[1] There is waste along the\\nentire value chain. Much occurs during\\nproduction, immediately after harvest or\\nduring storage - particularly in developing\\nor emerging countries, which often lack\\nadequate transportation or storage\\nfacilities. In industrialized countries, waste\\noccurs in food processing, delivery, and\\nespecially through the end-consumer\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\nbehavior. Much of what finds its way into a\\nconsumer\\xe2\\x80\\x99s fridge ends up as garbage.\\nEuropeans and North Americans throw\\naway between 95 and 115 kg of edible food\\nper capita each year.\\nThese various problems add up to a\\nHerculean task. Chemistry can contribute at\\ndifferent points to avoid food loss and food\\nwaste - in agriculture, for example, by\\nprotecting crops against pests and fungus\\nduring cultivation and after harvest.\\nChemistry also helps maintain yields. Feed\\ngrain is often moist immediately after\\nharvest and can become moldy. Treated\\nwith propionic acid, it can be stored for up\\nto 12 months.[2]\\nOne way to reduce food waste:\\nintelligent packaging\\nLet us jump to the end of the chain.\\nToday\\xe2\\x80\\x99s food packaging already involves a\\nlot of high tech. Although food often\\ntravels a long way from producer to\\nconsumer, sophisticated technologies make\\nit possible not to sacrifice freshness and\\nhygiene. One example is \\xe2\\x80\\x9cModified\\nAtmosphere Packaging.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d A protective\\natmosphere appropriate for a particular\\nfood replaces the air inside the packaging.\\nInert gases such as nitrogen or carbon\\ndioxide slow the growth of germs, doing\\naway with the need for preservatives.[3]\\nNevertheless, too much food is still being\\nthrown away. Intelligent packaging systems offer one solution for this. Antimicrobial\\nsurface coatings or labels can signal the quality of a product and prevent it from being discarded before the end of its actual shelf life.', 'mobile_status_update', '', '2015-10-11 08:07:10', 1, 0, 0)\n",

It will\\ntake you less than 2 minutes to\\npass it on.If you are not\\ninterested, or do not have the 2\\nMinutes it will take to do this,\\nplease don't complain when God\\ndoes not have time for you,\\nbecause He is far busier than we\\nare. Remember, Jesus said 'Deny\\nMe on earth and I'll deny you\\nbefore my Father. SHARE PLEASE\\nif\\nyou love JESUS!\", 'mobile_status_update', '', '2012-09-28 09:32:50', 0, 0, 0)\n",
